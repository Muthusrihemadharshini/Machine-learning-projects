Spam Email Detection System
Introduction
The Spam Email Detection System identifies spam emails by analyzing email content. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify emails as Spam or Not Spam.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, and removal of stopwords.
Spam Classification: Utilizes models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for performance measurement.
Dataset
The system uses the Spam Email Dataset containing labeled email samples.

Features: Word frequencies, character counts, special character frequencies
Classes: Spam (1) and Not Spam (0)
