## Car Price Prediction System  

### Introduction  
The Car Price Prediction System uses machine learning algorithms to estimate a car's price based on various input features such as mileage, year of manufacture, engine size, fuel type, and more. This system enables users to make informed decisions when buying or selling cars.  

---

### Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes raw car data.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: These include linear regression and random forest algorithms.  
- **Prediction Interface**: Interactive feature to input car details and get a predicted price.  

---

### Dataset  
This system uses a dataset containing information such as:  
- Manufacturer  
- Model  
- Year of Manufacture  
- Fuel Type (Petrol, Diesel, etc.)  
- Mileage and Engine Size  
- Number of Owners  
- Current Price

### Installation  

#### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.7+  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  

#### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/car-price-prediction.git  
   cd car-price-prediction  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

---

### Usage  

1. Run the script:  
   ```bash  
   python car_price_prediction.py  
   ```  
2. Enter car details (year, mileage, engine size, etc.) to get the predicted price.  

Example:  
```
Year: 2018  
Mileage (km): 40000  
Engine Size (cc): 1600  
Fuel Type: Petrol  
Predicted Price: $15,000  
```
