## Spam Email Detection System  

### Introduction  
The **Spam Email Detection System** identifies spam emails by analyzing email content. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.  

---

### Features  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, and removal of stopwords.  
- **Spam Classification**: Utilizes models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for performance measurement.  

---

### Dataset  
The system uses the [Spam Email Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase) containing labeled email samples.  
- Features: Word frequencies, character counts, special character frequencies  
- Classes: **Spam (1)** and **Not Spam (0)**

### Installation  

#### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.7+  
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`  

#### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/spam-email-detection.git  
   cd spam-email-detection  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

---

### Usage  

1. Run the detection script:  
   ```bash  
   python spam_email_detection.py  
   ```  
2. Input the email content to classify.  

Example:  
```
Email Content: "Congratulations! Youâ€™ve won $1,000,000. Click here to claim your prize."  
Classification: Spam  
```

### Results  
- Achieved a classification accuracy of ~98% using a Naive Bayes classifier.  
- Confusion Matrix indicates a high True Positive rate for spam detection.
