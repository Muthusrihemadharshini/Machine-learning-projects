Machine Learning Projects
Introduction
Welcome to my collection of Machine Learning Projects! This repository showcases a variety of ML-based applications developed for solving real-world problems using supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning techniques.

Each project is self-contained, with datasets, scripts, and instructions to recreate results and explore models.

Projects Included
Car Price Prediction

Predicts the market price of a car based on its features like mileage, year, and fuel type.
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest
Spam Email Detection

Identifies spam emails using NLP techniques.
Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
Iris Flower Classification

Classifies iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on petal and sepal dimensions.
Algorithm: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Others
